## Portlet's Context Script Executor (https://www.liferay.com/fr/marketplace/-/mp/application/59361035) :

This hook allows to execute scripts (groovy, javascript...) in control panel using all contexts (portlets, webs, hooks and portal) , so now we can access easily to portlets objects with script from the control panel, so we don't need to add this objects into public classloader.
